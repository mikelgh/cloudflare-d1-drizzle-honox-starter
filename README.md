# cloudflare-d1-drizzle-honox-starter

A starter project showing how you can integrate [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) and [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1) with a [HonoX](https://github.com/honojs/honox) application to build awesome full-stack apps.

> [!TIP]
> If the above paragraph was a bunch of buzzwords that seem confusing, here's the simple version:
>
> - HonoX is a _full-stack framework_ combining _backend API endpoints_ with the ability to render _frontend applications with React_
> - Cloudflare D1 is a _SQL database_
> - Drizzle ORM provides an _ORM wrapper_ around D1, to allow data models and querying using a straightforward syntax
